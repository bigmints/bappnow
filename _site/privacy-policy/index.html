<p>Bapp is a service oriented B2C/B2B mobile app enabling consumers with small and medium business to engage in a “service booking” type of arrangements &amp; appointments.</p>

<p>This privacy policy (this “Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Growgene Tech Solutions FZ-E. with its registered office in Dubai Free zone and all its designated agents, employees and subsidiaries (“Growgene” or “we”). This Policy applies to consumer users (individually referred to as “you”) of Bapp websites, applications, and other online services (collectively, our “Sites”).</p>

<p>Other third parties, such as small and medium businesses (“SMBs”) at which you make reservations through our Sites, issuers of Merchant Gift Cards you purchase through our Sites, and social networks that you use in connection with our Sites, may also collect, use, and share information about you. This Policy does not cover such third parties or their services. For information about third-party privacy practices, please consult with them directly.</p>

<h2 id="part-i---information-we-collect">Part I - Information We Collect.</h2>

You play an important role in keeping your personal information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your Bapp account with anyone. If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will consider that you have authorized the instructions.</p>
